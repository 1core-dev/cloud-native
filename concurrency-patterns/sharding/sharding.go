// Package sharding implements a thread-safe map with partitioned data (sharding)
// to reduce lock contention in highly concurrent environments.

// ShardedMap splits data into multiple shards, each protected by its own read-write lock.
// This allows concurrent operations on different parts of the map without blocking each other.

// The pattern is particularly useful for scenarios where:
//  - You need efficient parallel access to a shared key-value store.
//  - Lock contention from frequent reads/writes becomes a bottleneck.
//  - Data fits within a single service instance and does not require horizontal sharding across distributed systems.

// Sharding improves performance by partitioning data within a single service instance (vertical sharding),
// making it ideal for services with high concurrency but without the complexity of distributed data systems.
